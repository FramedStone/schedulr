            <h2>Privacy Policy for schedulr Chrome Extension</h2>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 14 August 2024</p>

            <p>Thank you for using "schedulr," a Chrome extension that helps you scrape your timetable from the CliC platform and insert it
            into Google Calendar. I value your privacy and am committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines
            how I collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use my extension.</p>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h3>1. Information I Collect</h3>
                <p><strong>Google Account Information:</strong> The extension requires access to your Google Calendar account to insert your
                timetable. This is managed through OAuth2 authentication, and only the necessary scopes to manage calendar events
                are requested</p>
                <p><strong>Timetable Data:</strong> The extension scrapes your timetable data from the CliC platform to populate events in
                your Google Calendar.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h3>2. How I Use Your Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Google Calendar Integration:</strong> The sole purpose of this extension is to add your scraped timetable events
                into your Google Calendar. No data is stored or transmitted to any external servers, and all data handling is done locally
                within your browser.</p>
                <p><strong>User Authentication:</strong> OAuth2 is used to authenticate your Google account, allowing the extension to
                manage your Google Calendar events.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h3>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
                <p>I do not share, sell, or otherwise disclose your personal information to third parties. 
                The data processed by the extension is only used for integrating your timetable into Google Calendar.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h3>4. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
                <p>The Schedulr Chrome extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. 
                The extension only accesses your Google Calendar to add new events (your classes) directly into your calendar. 
                No data is retained by the extension after these events are added.</p>

                <p>Since the extension does not store any data, there is no data to delete. 
                If you wish to stop the extension from accessing your Google Calendar, you can simply remove the extension from your browser.
                Additionally, you can revoke the extension's access to your Google Calendar at any time through your Google Account settings 
                by navigating to <strong>"Security" > "Third-party apps with account access" > "Manage third-party access"</strong>
                , and removing the Schedulr extension from the list.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h3>5. Security</h3>
                <p>I take reasonable measures to protect your data while using my extension. 
                However, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, 
                and I cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
            </div>
