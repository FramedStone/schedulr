## Why this project? 🛌
Imagine a world where you can automate your life away, cool right? The idea was so could spend less time transferring my timetable manually every semester but it feels like I spent more time building than I'll spend transferring them manually...oh well.

Also, this is my first web related project so if you see any room for improvement do let me know :)
