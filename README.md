## Why this project? 🛌
Imagine a world where you can automate your life - cool right? I initially created this to save time on manually transferring my timetable but it seems I've spend more time building it than I would have transferring the timetable manually...oh well.

Since this is my first web project, I'd love to hear any suggetions for improvements you might have!

## Buy me a coffee ☕
I seem to have developed a bit of an addiction to espresso shots, so if you're feeling generous, feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/sycanz)!
