## Why this project? 🛌
Imagine a world where you can automate your life - cool right? I initially created this to save time on manually transferring my timetable but it seems I've spend more time building it than I would have transferring the timetable manually...oh well.

Since this is my first web project, I'd love to hear any suggetions for improvements you might have!
